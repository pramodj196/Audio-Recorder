# Audio-Recorder

We designed a simple voice recorder using an ATmega328p microcontroller which exposed us to the real world of programming, debugging, implementing algorithms, and building circuits.
We managed to successfully record an audio signal and save it on an SD card as a .txt file and play it back with an added effect of choice; treble, bass, echo, or no effect. An LCD screen and push buttons were used for navigation. Initially, the project was implemented and tested using an Arduino Uno board and later was implemented to the ATmega328p chip. 

Fields we got hands-on experience on:
1. Arduino programming
2. AVR C++ programming
3. PCB designing using Altium
4. Enclosure designing using Solidworks. 
5. Recording a voice signal and playing it back using 8 bit PCM techniques
6. Adding audio enhancements to the recorded voice signal

Challenges we overcame:
1. Sampling an audio signal at 9.2kHz
2. Completing the prototype using an Arduino Uno board and limited number of components available in the Sri Lankan market during the pandemic 
3. Beginners at programming on AVR and Arduino platforms
4. Beginners at audio processing techniques

This project was done in semester 2 under the supervision of Mr. Bhanuka Silva, Junior Lecturer at the University of Moratuwa.
